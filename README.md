![50.002 Computational Structures 2019 Demo](https://github.com/careylzh/theSkyIsFalling/blob/master/theSkyIsFalling.gif) | <div align="left">Virgin attempt at using a simple FPGA + HDL to create an old school arcade game.<br/> __Software__: Alchitry Labs, PlanAhead Synthesizer, no test bench <br/> __Hardware__: Mojo v3 by Alchitry Labs (Spartan 6 XC6SLX9 FPGA, super relatively low-end FPGA) <br/> Hardware Description "Programming" __Language Used__: Lucid (simplified verilog hardware description language) <br/> <br/> Thank you Prof Natalie Agus for your assistance. Assistance is an understatement <br/>

various mem architecture in diff versions, but the TLDR is that we tried block ram 512 DFFs instead of the current design</div>
