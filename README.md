# Elementary FPGA for Arcade Game (School Proj)

Software: Alchitry Labs, PlanAhead Synthesizer, no test bench <br/>
Hardware: Mojo v3 by Alchitry Labs (Spartan 6 XC6SLX9 FPGA, super relatively low-end FPGA) <br/>
Hardware Description "Programming" Language Used: Lucid (simplified verilog hardware description language) <br/>

Virgin attempt at using a simple FPGA + HDL to create an old school arcade game. <br/>

no comments <br/>
various mem architecture in diff versions, but the TLDR is that we tried block ram 512 DFFs instead of the current design
